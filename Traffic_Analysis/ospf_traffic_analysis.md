# OSPF Traffic Analysis

## 1. OSPF Hello Packets
- OSPF Hello packets are exchanged every 10 seconds on broadcast networks.
- The capture file `01_OSPF_Hello_Packets.pcapng` shows an OSPF neighbor forming process.
- Key fields in Hello packets:
  - **Router ID**: Identifies the sending router.
  - **Area ID**: Must match between neighbors.
  - **Hello/Dead Interval**: If mismatched, adjacencies wonâ€™t form.

## 2. OSPF LSA Propagation
- `02_OSPF_LSA_Updates.pcapng` captures Link-State Advertisements.
- LSA Type 1 (Router LSA) shows each network attached to router's OSPF interfaces.
- LSA Type 2 (Network LSA) advertises multi-access networks.
- LSA Type 5 (External LSA) generated by ASBRs to describe routes to destination outside of the AS (OSPF Domain).

## 3. OSPF Route Changes
- `03_OSPF_Routing_Table_Changes.pcapng` captures OSPF reacting to a downed link.
- The routing table changes within seconds, as seen in:
  ```bash
  show ip route ospf
